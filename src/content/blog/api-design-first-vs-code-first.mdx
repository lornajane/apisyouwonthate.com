With API descriptions rising in popularity, the main question I hear folks asking about is "API Design-first" or "code-first". This is a bit of a misleading question because these are not two unique things, there are a few variants. 

## Code-First, Write Docs "When We Have Time" 

![](../../images/posts/api-design-first-vs-code-first/wf-1.png)

This is how I came into contact with API description documents like OpenAPI or API Blueprint in the first place, and it is how our first book suggested API developers do things. This may have made sense at the time, but I quickly discovered it to be an immature workflow.

One issue here is that "code-first and meh docs later" treats API descriptions like a fancy way of making API reference documentation, which is one of 100 things API descriptions can do. API descriptions are machine readable files with a plethora of data and metadata, which can used to gather feedback from early stages to improve the quality of the API before it's even written through [mocking](https://stoplight.io/prism/), offer [client-side validation](/blog/the-many-amazing-uses-of-json-schema-client-side-validation) and [server-side validation](/blog/server-side-validation-with-api-descriptions/). 

Writing a bunch of code first, deploying the thing, getting clients onboarded with special hands-on treatment, etc. is a whole lot of work. When this whole phase is done, spending a month writing up documentation which will "only get out of date" can feel like a giant chore, one that most businesses struggle to prioritize so the task just never gets done. 

This was the excuse I heard regularly for why WeWork, a company with ~50 engineers in 2016 managed to build ~30 APIs with zero documentation at any point. The lack of documentation lead to some of the most bonkers time-and-money-wasting I've ever come across, with folks building out [new versions of endpoints and APIs](/blog/api-versioning-has-no-right-way/) because nobody could remember how the code worked. Even reading the code was almost impossible due to API A dynamically returning mushed together chunks of JSON from API B and API C [without any serializers involved](https://phil.tech/api/2015/05/30/serializing-api-output/). 

"We'll write documentation later" means "We will not write documentation", and by the time you discover you need it, it'll be too late. On the off-chance you are one of the few who get it done quickly, keeping these documents "in sync" with the code is the biggest problem most developers faced. At my talk on this subject at [API the Docs](https://apithedocs.org/amsterdam2019), the entire room of ~80-100 people put their hand up when I asked "Who here struggles with keeping code and docs in sync"? 

There are [a few approaches](/blog/keeping-documentation-honest), but even if you absolutely nail using [Dredd](https://dredd.org/) or similar tooling to keep things synced up, there is the other rather large problem we've not covered yet: the fact that you built the whole API before giving your customers a chance to play with it. 

[Mocking](https://stoplight.io/mocking/) is too often overlooked, and people waste time and money building out nonsense APIs which don't help their customers. This usually means a v2 comes quickly after the v1, and maybe a v3 is required as a few more clients get involved and give more feedback. This usually means the API was too normalized, leading to the client needing to make 150 HTTP requests to solve their use case, or the resources are giant meaning there is good data hidden amongst 100 fields the user didn't need. 

[Use-case driven APIs](https://medium.com/@__xuorig__/the-tension-between-data-use-case-driven-graphql-apis-8f982198653b) are usually way more useful than data-driven APIs, regardless of the API [paradigm you picked](/blog/picking-the-right-api-paradigm/) for the API build. Let your users share their feedback early, when it's still cheap and easy to change things - not when it's already in production and change gets more complex.

## Code-First, then Annotate

![](../../images/posts/api-design-first-vs-code-first/wf-2.png)

This popular variation of the code-first approach to API descriptions the effort to speed up the "documentation later" part of the process, a lot of API developers decide to use annotations or code comments to litter their source code with bits of the API description in a special format.

Multiple tools exist for this. In some strictly typed languages the annotation tooling contains very little information, mostly only things like human-readable descriptions. Information like basic types ("string" and "integer") can be inferred from the code, wether null is allowed, etc. can all be picked up. Sadly some people think that is all the information they need to put into a description document. They ignore things like example values, formats like "email" or "date-time" which can add validation benefits and make documentation more useful, and other more advanced features in OpenAPI or JSON Schema like allOf, oneOf, etc. 

Languages with annotations as a first class feature generally support this a bit better, like Java. They have a multitude of annotation systems which can give you syntax errors if you write rubbish in there.

```java
class UserController {
  @OpenApi(
      path = "/users",
      method = HttpMethod.POST,
      // ...
  )
  public static void createUser(Context ctx) {
      // ...
  }
}
```

Other languages like PHP rely on doc block comments, and that's just writing nonsense into a text editor. 

```php
/**
  * @OA\Get(path="/2.0/users/{username}",
  *   operationId="getUserByName",
  *   @OA\Parameter(name="username",
  *     in="path",
  *     required=true,
  *     description=Explaining all about the username parameter
  *     @OA\Schema(type="string")
  *   ),
  *   @OA\Response(response="200",
  *     description="The User",
  *     @OA\JsonContent(ref="#/components/schemas/user"),
  *     @OA\Link(link="userRepositories", ref="#/components/links/UserRepositories")
  *   )
  * )
  */
public function getUserByName($username, $newparam)
{
}
```

This looks rough to me, but folks defend it with reasoning like: "having the annotations near the code means developers are more likely to keep it up to date". More likely is not definitely.

Using annotations you still need to use one of the approaches to making sure code and descriptions are in sync, but you have to add a build step to export from source code and then run that generated OpenAPI file through Dredd or similar. Or you can just hope that all of your developers remember and "it'll be fine".

The feedback loop here is still a bit long. It comes after you've written a whole bunch of code, or maybe you wrote all the routes to a bunch of empty controllers, and can export the OpenAPI to create a mock server, but that all still sounds like a lot of work. There are more improvements to be made.

## Design First, Ditch for Code First

![](../../images/posts/api-design-first-vs-code-first/wf-3.png)

In general, "API Design First" is about closing the feedback loop substantially. You get mocks and docs before you write any code, so there is no more mucking about with code until a decent number of clients have confirmed the interfaces look good for their needs, and seeing as you already have what you need to generate docs you don't have to worry about doing it later. 

This specific flavour of design-first still has a lot of problems, yet recently a few big names in the API world have been advocating for this. Mainly I think they advocate for it because they are sick of writing API descriptions by hand: insert the usual complaints about "thousands of lines of YAML" here. Maybe they use a DSL to design things at first, then switch to annotations once things are done, again hoping "it will be more likely to stay up to date" that way.

One of multiple falsehoods here is the idea that there is a design phase, then you stop designing things and it's time for the code to happen, and we don't need to do design new functionality after that. 

Regardless of whether devs write the API code by hand or generate it from API descriptions, there is no end to the design phase. Design is a circular life-cycle with a feedback loop which leads to new resources and endpoints, or new global versions, or just new properties. APIs evolve over time, and rolling out new functionality without gathering feedback from customers is always a bad idea, not just in the initial design phase. 

I have seen some success from folks at [Meetup](https://meetup.com/) using "immutable services", where they generate routes, controllers, data models, docker config, even all the kubernetes setup, all from OpenAPI, then they just slap in a bit of business logic in the empty gaps and hit deploy. What happens when they need to make changes to the contract? That'll be a brand new service. No change allowed. Plan things well enough you don't need to tweak em for ages, then deprecate and replace them if change is required. Immutable services are not a common way to do things, and require a huge amount of discipline to get right. 

For everyone else, evolution is more common, because even folks using major global versions for their API will make backwards compatible changes as they go (new endpoints, etc.) Tooling which asks you to "Import" OpenAPI then go on from there without it is condemning you to a design-less future for new functionality, even if they offer an Export OpenAPI feature (which many don't).

Worse than that, many of these tools keep their own version of your API description in the cloud, which can change independently of the API description you have in your Git repo, meaning you don't a sources of truth: _you have two sources of lies._

Let's look at a workflow which allows you to use API descriptions as a single source of truth, which evolves along with your code.

## Design-First, Evolve with Code

![](../../images/posts/api-design-first-vs-code-first/wf-4.png)

This approach stops treating API description documents like an afterthought, or like a chore, because they aren't. DSL's might have been required to [make writing OpenAPI bearable](https://developer.squareup.com/blog/making-openapi-swagger-bearable-with-your-own-dsl/) in the past, but with stunning visual editors like [Stoplight Studio](https://stoplight.io/studio/), the days of using DSLs as a crutch to avoid hand-rolling YAML are behind us. Studio lets you work with your OpenAPI files on your local machine, for free, so anyone can easily build up powerful description documents, and even easily reuse models between multiple APIs so the whole "thousand lines of YAML" thing completely falls away.

Whether you use Studio, DSL, or write it by hand, start off in your empty repo with just the description documents. Run a mock server early and often, get feedback from your customers, then commit the documents once things are agreed.

Then you can start writing code. The amount of code you need to write can be drastically simplified with tooling that uses your description documents to power [server-side validation](/blog/server-side-validation-with-api-descriptions/), or even API Gateway validation.

This is not code generation, but it is using your code to power production validation. The same description documents that you are using to render documentation are now powering the most complex aspect of your API, and things can never be "out of sync" because there is only one source of truth. 

When customers request new functionality, it is easy to add new endpoints, introduce new properties, etc., and get feedback on that new stuff before you start writing the code. At no point do you lose that ability, so you can benefit from design first, design again, and again. 

This does not help keep responses "in sync", but seeing as your description documents are sat right there in your repo, you can use them to [drastically simplify your unit/integration testing](/blog/writing-documentation-via-contract-testing) anyway, so the whole interface is covered. 

Don't half-ass your description documents. Use them to plan something amazing, and cut down the amount of recoding you need to do down the line. Create APIs which last longer, which are better documented, better tested, all whilst reducing the total amount of time spent developing the API overall.
