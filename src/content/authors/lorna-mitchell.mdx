I'm a Developer Advocate with Nexmo, where I express my polyglot tendencies by taming our various code repos in a selection of tech stacks. I've been an API enthusiast for a number of years and my books include "PHP Web Services" by O'Reilly and "N Ways to be a Better Developer" which you can find on LeanPub. I'm passionate about open source, technology in general and about sharing knowledge, code and experience with developers everywhere. In my spare time, I blog at https://lornajane.net.
